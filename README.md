# EASiTool 5.0 User Guide

## Getting Started

To utilize EASiTool 5.0 effectively, follow these steps:

- **Download the Template Input File:**
  - Start by selecting the unit system.
  - Download the provided template input file based on unit system selection.
  - Edit this file as needed to match your specific project requirements.

## Module Selection

EASiTool 5.0 offers two main modules to cater to different project scenarios:

1. **User Given Inputs (Given Geometry, Constant Injection/Extraction Rate)**
   - Choose this module if you have:
     - Detailed project and well locations information.
     - Fixed injection and extraction rates.

2. **Maximum Storage Capacity (Fixed Bottomhole Pressure)**
   - Opt for this module if you are working on a general project without specific well locations or detailed well information.

## EASiTool Results

EASiTool 5.0 generates the following results for your carbon capture and storage (CCS) project:

- Net Present Value (NPV) and CO2 capacity evaluation 
- Pressure Contour Map
- COâ‚‚ Plume Extension Map
- Well Pressure/Flow Rates Map
- Area of Review (AoR) Evaluations
- Sensitivity Analysis

Additionally, EASiTool provides Geographic Information System (GIS) maps, and optimized NPV and capacity versus the number of injection wells.

### Sensitivity Analysis

For sensitivity analysis, EASiTool includes:

- Tornado Chart
- Sensitivity analysis of capacity estimation using the Monte Carlo Simulation via random sampling technique

**Note**: In the context of EASiTool, MMT stands for "million metric tons."
